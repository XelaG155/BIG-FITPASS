# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a new or empty repository named "BIG-FITPASS" with minimal setup. The repository currently contains only a `.claude/settings.local.json` file with basic permission configurations.

## Current Structure

- `.claude/` - Claude Code configuration directory
  - `settings.local.json` - Local permissions configuration (allows Bash ls commands)

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, no specific build, test, or lint commands are available yet. When code is added to this repository, this file should be updated with:

- Build commands
- Test execution commands
- Linting and formatting commands
- Development server startup commands

## Architecture

The repository structure and architecture will need to be documented as the codebase develops. Based on the name "BIG-FITPASS", this may be related to fitness or pass management functionality.

## Notes for Future Development

- This repository is currently empty and ready for initial code setup
- Consider adding a README.md when the project structure is established
- Update this CLAUDE.md file with specific commands and architecture details as the codebase grows
